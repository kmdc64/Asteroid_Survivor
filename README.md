# Asteroid_Survivor
A simple game where the player accumalates points through dodging endless asteroids. I spent a few evenings working on this as a learning project for developing my C++ knowledge, as my past game development experience has been coding mostly in C# and a bit of Python. It was developed in C++ using the RayLib library for rendering.
